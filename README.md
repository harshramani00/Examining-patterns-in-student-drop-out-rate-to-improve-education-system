# ðŸ“ˆ Examining Patterns in Student Dropout Rates to Improve the Education System

This project uses **D3.js** for dynamic, interactive data visualizations to explore patterns in student dropout rates. By analyzing datasets and visualizing correlations, the project aims to identify key factors influencing student retention and provide actionable insights to support educational policy and intervention strategies.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights
- Interactive visualizations built with **D3.js**
- Plots include bar charts, chord diagrams, scatter plots, and heatmaps
- Datasets include raw and preprocessed student data (`data.csv`, `preprocessed_data.csv`, etc.)
- Provides insights into dropout patterns across different demographics, regions, and performance metrics

---

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js
- **Backend**: Flask (`app.py`)
- **Data**: CSV files for student performance and dropout statistics
